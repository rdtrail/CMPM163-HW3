# CMPM163 HW3

## Homework 3A
### None.

## Homework 3B
### I used solely the Fragment Shader to create 2 moving geometries: 1 as a plain blue color and 1 with a rainbow texture. These geometries change (and even split apart and rejoin) overtime. They also react to light.

## Homework 3C
### This is a PDF describing my final project ideas and teammates. We will be focusing of Deferred Shading.

## Screenshots of Part B
